TASKS
---------

* If the player presses "r", restart the game.
* If the player presses "q", end the game. 
* Currently, the game only works for vertical movement (w/s). Add/change the code so that horizontal movement is possible (A/S)
* We want you to add a score similar to what you see in image 1. Each number eaten should be 1 point
* As in image 1 show the total percentage of numbers eaten.

Extra credits (only do this if you have completed the main task and you want a challenge):
-----------------

* Have the game end if the player has no more legal moves. 
* Change the code so that the player does not have to push "Enter" after selecting an action. 
* Create a persistent high-score list displayed after the player exits the game.
